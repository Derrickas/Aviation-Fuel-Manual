- Notify your locations appropriate HS&E Manager.
- Immediately research what operators of all other aircraft were fueled prior to or since the suspected fueling. This would include the operators fueled by the suspected vehicle(s) and associated fuel storage system.
- Perform the following tests on the suspected fuel vehicle and storage system.
  - Downstream Filter membrane color test (Millipore) -Jet systems only. 2) Downstream Free water test -Jet systems only.

<sup>0</sup>

- 1. API Gravity cotTected to 60F -Avgas & Jet systems.
  - Tank and Filter Sump Visual Appearance test (White bucket) -Avgas & Jet systems 5) Record time and results of tests performed.

NOTE Proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) must be worn at all times.

- Obtain two samples (utilize approved epoxy coated shipping containers) from each fueling vehicle in the suspected fueling and two samples from each airport storage tank serving the fueling equipment. If at all possible, draw samples from the aircraft in question. Identify, seal, tag and retain these samples pending further instructions.
  - RefuelerTrucks:

• Collect two samples (Jet - 2 one gallon, Avgas- I five gallon and I one gallon) from the delivery nozzle.

- 1. Hydrant Trucks and Carts:

• Collect two (one gallon samples) from the delivery nozzle.

- 1. Fuel Facility Storage Tanks:![](data:image/jpeg;base64,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)

• Collect two (one gallon samples) from each storage tank that was on line servicing the fueling equipment.

- 1. Aircraft involved in incident (if at all possible):

• Collect a one gallon sample from each main tank.

CAUTION:

It is very important when you are drawing samples into the sample cans to flush out the can three times with product from the same source you want your final sample from. This is called 'Pickling' the can. If at all possible, minimize drawing your sample through brass or copper fittings, as this could change the outcome of the Thermo Stability Test.

NOTE

If possible, when taking samples, have a third-party present to witness the sample(s) being taken and the sealing of the sample container(s). If witnessing by a third party is not possible, have another one of our employees witness the procedure. In either instance, you must get a signed and dated statement from the witness verifying the sample collection (how much and from where), and the sealing and labeling of sample container.

- Perforrn a complete operational check of the suspect fuel vehicle to include surge and pressure controls, nozzle screen checks etc. FSII injectors should be evaluated as independent systems. FSII containers and storage procedures should be evaluated, as appropriate. Record and retain information.
