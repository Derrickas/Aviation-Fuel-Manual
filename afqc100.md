## Aviation Fuel Quality Control Manual - 2025 Edition

AFQC-100 - DEFINITIONS, TERMS & SPECIFICATIONS

November 2025 (Rev A)

## 100.1 Definitions

The following definitions apply to terminology used throughout the FSM Aviation Fuel Quality Control Manual (AFQCM). These terms align with ATA Specification 103, Energy Institute (EI) 1542, and current industry practice.

Additive: A chemical compound introduced into fuel to enhance performance, stability, or handling characteristics.

Adsorption: The adhesion of molecules, atoms, or ions to a solid surface, typically within filter media.

API Gravity: A measure of fuel density expressed in degrees API, indicating relative lightness or heaviness compared to water.

Batch: A defined quantity of fuel produced, transported, or stored as a single unit with uniform properties.

Cathodic Protection: A corrosion-prevention method that utilizes an electrical current to counteract galvanic action.

Deadman Control: A safety device requiring operator engagement to maintain fuel flow; automatically shuts off flow if released.

Differential Pressure: The pressure difference measured across filter elements, indicating condition and flow resistance.

Emulsion: A suspension of fine droplets of one liquid within another, such as water in fuel.

Flash Point: The lowest temperature at which fuel vapors ignite in the presence of an ignition source.

Free Water: Water present in fuel in a visible, separable state as opposed to dissolved water.

Micron: A unit of measure equal to one millionth of a meter, used to specify filtration rating.

Prefilter: A coarse filter element used to remove large contaminants before final filtration.

Surfactant: A chemical compound that reduces surface tension, often introduced inadvertently from detergents or additives.

Thermohydrometer: A device used to determine both fuel temperature and density simultaneously.

Turbine Fuel: A refined petroleum product intended for use in turbine-powered aircraft engines (Jet A, Jet A-1).

## 100.2 Product Identification

The following table summarizes standard properties and color codes for aviation fuels handled by FSM Group facilities. All properties conform to ASTM D1655 (Jet Fuels) and ASTM D910 (Aviation Gasolines).

| Fuel Type | Color | API Gravity (Typical) | Flash Point °F | Freeze Point °C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jet A | Straw / Colorless | 37-51 | 100 min | \-40 max |
| Jet A-1 | Straw / Colorless | 37-51 | 100 min | \-47 max |
| Avgas 100 | Green | 63-70 | −45 min | N/A |
| Avgas 100LL | Blue | 63-70 | −45 min | N/A |
| Avgas 80 | Red | 63-70 | −45 min | N/A |

## 100.3 Color Coding System

FSM Group adheres to the color-coding system defined in EI 1542 for aviation fuel identification. All hoses, pipes, and fueling equipment must display bands or markings corresponding to product type and color as shown below:

| Product | Identification Band | Color Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jet A / Jet A-1 | Black band with white 'JET A' | Black / White |
| Avgas 100 | Green band with white 'AVGAS 100' | Green / White |
| Avgas 100LL | Blue band with white 'AVGAS 100LL' | Blue / White |
| Avgas 80 | Red band with white 'AVGAS 80' | Red / White |

## 100.4 Sample Terminology

The following terminology applies to aviation fuel sampling and testing procedures:  
\- \*\*Water Draw Sample:\*\* Obtained from the lowest point of a tank to check for water presence.  
\- \*\*Line Sample:\*\* Taken from a pipeline to verify fuel integrity during transfer.  
\- \*\*Hose Sample:\*\* Collected from a delivery hose to confirm cleanliness before fueling.  
\- \*\*Composite Sample:\*\* A combination of samples taken from multiple points or times for average representation.  
\- \*\*Drip Sample:\*\* Collected via continuous flow during system operation.  
\- \*\*Discrete Sample:\*\* A single, non-combined sample representing one location or time.

## 100.5 Contaminants

Fuel contamination may originate from solid particles, water, or surfactants introduced during production, storage, or handling. Contaminants must be detected, identified, and removed before fuel release for use.

\*\*A. Solid Contaminants:\*\* Include rust, dust, sand, scale, fibers, and microbial matter. Prevention relies on effective filtration, tank housekeeping, and filter-element maintenance.

\*\*B. Water Contamination:\*\* Exists in dissolved, emulsified, or free form. Free water poses corrosion and icing hazards and must be removed via settling, water drains, or filter-separators.

\*\*C. Surfactant Contamination:\*\* Caused by detergent carryover from tank cleaning or additive mixing. Surfactants reduce coalescer efficiency and increase filter element differential pressure. Affected systems must be flushed and inspected prior to return to service.

## 100.6 Static Electricity

Fuel movement generates static electricity, which can create ignition hazards. Preventive measures include proper grounding, bonding, controlled flow rates, and elimination of splash filling. Operators must ensure all conductive components are electrically continuous before fuel transfer begins.

## 100.7 Custodianship and Document Control

The Corporate Quality Assurance department is responsible for maintaining and updating this section. All terminology, tables, and specifications shall be reviewed periodically to ensure alignment with ATA 103, ASTM D1655, and Energy Institute 1542 standards. Digital record retention and revision tracking shall be managed in accordance with AFQC-710.

## 100.8 Improvement Integration Note

This chapter integrates improvements from FSM's 2026 AFQCM Improvement Plan, including standardized terminology, expanded fuel identification tables, cross-references to digital recordkeeping systems, and consistent color-coding alignment with international specifications.
