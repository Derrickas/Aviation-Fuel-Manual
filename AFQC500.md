500.1 DEFUELNG PROCEDURES (General)

Any operation that involves removing fuel from an aircraft, either for load adjustments or for maintenance purposes, is defined as de-fueling. De-fueling operations require specialconsideration.When requested to do any de-fuels for load adjustment, maintenance or contamination, the carrier, aircraft owner, etc., shall be responsible for the disposition of the fuel that was removed from their aircraft; whether it is pumped back into their aircraft over a specified agreed time, or disposed of through a waste hauler, etc. This includes the product de- fueled and any product it comes in contact with, i.e., if there is any product in the tanker truck used for de-fuel.

WARNNG!

Fuel trucks utilizing monitors for Jet fuel filtration shall not be used for defueling aircraft.

# NOTE

Defueling aircraft directly into joint use fueling systems is not authorized unless all system users have unanimously approved a written procedure. The approval must come from the Quality Assurance Departments of each user and must be in writing.

# CAUTION

Receive fuel into an empty vehicle whenever possible, or other vehicle equipped for this purpose. If the defuel truck is not empty, the ullage (available storage capacity) must be calculated either by inventory records or strapping chart. Any remaining fuel in the defuel truck becomes part of the defueled product and must be returned to the responsible air carrier or owner.

WARNNG!

Defueled product shall not be returned to airport storage.

500.2 DE-FUELNG PROCEDURES FOR LOAD ADJUSTMENT/MANTENANCE 500.2.1 Procedures: The following procedures shall be complied with when defueling an aircraft for loadadjustment/maintenance:

- Complete a Visual Appearance Test on sump samples drawn from the filter sump (under pressure) and all tank compartments on the defuel truck.
- Complete a Visual Appearance Test on a composite sample utilizing all aircraft tanks to be defueled looking for visible contamination such as water, particulates and microbial growth, ifpractical.
- If results of checks outlined above give, without any doubt, no reason to suspect the quality of the fuel, begin Defueling. Utilize the bottom-load pre-check to determine

On ly

that high-level protection is operable. If not, a monitor must be placed on the ladder to monitor the fuel level through an open dome cover.

- After defueling, and prior to uploading the defueled product, allow the fueling vehicle to settle for 10 minutes then drain at least one gallon of fuel from the tank sump(s) into a suitable container and perform a visual inspection.
- Upon completion of de-fueling, re-circulate through a re-circulation connection, not the bottom loading connection unless it connects directly into the tank and not through the tank internal valve, a volume equivalent to the contents of the Refueler, and then perform the following:

I) Clear and bright test from all tank compartments and filter sump 2) API gravity corrected to 60<sup>0</sup>F. (Range must be between 37<sup>0</sup> to 51 <sup>0</sup> API). 3) Filter vessel differentialpressure.

4) Free Water Test, utilizing one of the following test kits (Results must be <15ppm):

(a)Shell Free Water Test Kit (b)Metrocator Free Water Test Kit (c)Velcon Hydro-kit 5) Record all test results.

O If the fuel passes the tests outlined above in Section 500.2 item "e", the fuel may then be pumped back into the same or other aircraft owned by the same carrier. De-fueled product shall not be pumped into another carriers or owners aircraft without the explicit written permission of their Fuel Quality Assurance Department or in the instance of a private aircraft, the owner.

# CAUTION

If the fuel is found to be contaminated, the fuel shall be held in quarantine until selected fuel quality, purity or specification tests have determined its acceptability and can be returned to aircraft use. Selected product tests and expected acceptance criteria are to be determined the Fuel Quality Control Department, and mutually agreed upon, by the Air

Carrier Quality Assurance Department, if applicable. If it is determined that the fuel has to be disposed of, the carrier representative or aircraft owner shall be notified that they will bear the costs incurred in the disposal of the product as well as costs for cleaning the Refueler tank and filter change.

500.3 DE-FUEL FOR POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION

# CAUTION

Receive fuel into an Empty vehicle whenever possible, or other vehicle equipped for this purpose.

- Procedures: The following procedures shall be complied with when defueling

an aircraft that is suspected of having contamination. Complete a Visual Appearance Test on sump samples drawn from the filter sump (under pressure) and all tank compartments on the defuel truck.

- Complete a Visual Appearance Test on a composite sample utilizing all aircraft tanks to be defueled looking for visible contamination such as water, particulates and microbial growth (mandatory).
- Measure API gravity-corrected to 60<sup>0</sup>F ofcomposite sample collected from AC tanks
- Perform Free Water Test on composite sample, utilizing one ofthe following test kits (Results must be <15ppm):
  - Shell Free Water Test Kit
  - Metrocator Free Water Test Kit (c) Velcon Hydro-kit
- De-fuel the product and retain in quarantine. Utilize the bottom-load pre-check to determine that high-level protection is operable. Ifnot, a monitor must be placed on the ladder to monitor the fuel level through an open dome cover.
- The vehicle used forthe de-fueling operation shall be removed from service and the fuel shall be held in quarantine until selected fuel quality, purity or specification tests have been detennined its acceptability and can bereturned to aircraft use.
- Selected product tests and expected acceptance criteria are to be determined by the Fuel Quality Control Deparünent, and mutually agreed upon, by the Air Carrier Quality Assurance Department, if applicable. Ifit is determined that the fuel has to be disposed of, the carrier representative or aircraft owner shall be notified that they will bear the costs incurred in the disposal of the product as well as costs for cleaning the Refueler tank and filter change.
