All FSM facilities and personnel performing fuel quality control functions shall comply with the policies outlined herein.

## 30.2 Program Overview and Scope

The Aviation Fuel Quality Control Program (AFQCP) establishes a uniform system for ensuring product integrity, operational safety, and compliance with regulatory and customer requirements. This program applies to all FSM-operated and managed fuel storage, handling, and into-plane operations. It covers all activities from fuel receipt to delivery, including inspection, testing, documentation, and reporting.

## 30.3 General Manager Responsibilities

The General Manager (GM) at each FSM facility has overall responsibility for ensuring the effective implementation of the AFQCP. Key responsibilities include:  
1\. Ensuring all personnel are trained, qualified, and authorized to perform assigned duties.  
2\. Reviewing and approving facility quality control documentation and test records.  
3\. Maintaining compliance with all regulatory and FSM Group quality standards.  
4\. Conducting periodic management reviews of program performance and audit results.  
5\. Ensuring deficiencies identified during inspections or audits are corrected promptly.  
6\. Verifying that all digital records and reports are properly maintained in accordance with AFQC-710.

## 30.4 Quality Control Personnel Responsibilities

Quality Control (QC) personnel are responsible for conducting inspections, sampling, testing, and documentation activities as defined in this manual. Responsibilities include:  
1\. Performing all required fuel sampling and testing in accordance with FSM and industry procedures.  
2\. Maintaining accurate, legible, and timely records of inspections and test results.  
3\. Reporting any product discrepancies, equipment failures, or unsafe conditions immediately to supervision.  
4\. Ensuring testing equipment calibration records are current and traceable (see AFQC-50).  
5\. Participating in training programs as required by AFQC-900 to maintain competency.

## 30.5 Training and Competency Requirements

All personnel involved in fuel quality control operations must complete and maintain training as defined in AFQC-900.

Competency assessments must be documented at least annually or whenever new processes or equipment are introduced.

## 30.6 Recordkeeping and Documentation Standards

All quality control records, reports, and logs shall be considered controlled documents. Records must be accurate, legible, and maintained in compliance with FSM's Digital Record Control Standard (AFQC-710).

Records shall be retained for the duration specified by FSM Group's document retention policy or applicable regulations.

## 30.7 Program Evaluation and Continuous Improvement
