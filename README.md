 200.1 FUEL STORAGE FACILITY REQUIREMENTS (General) 

> Fuel storage facilities/systems are designed to assure product
> segregation in order to prevent the accidental mixing of dissimilar
> fuels; therefore, the system must be properly designed, color-coded
> and placarded for the type and grade of fuel in each tank.
>
> Protection of the ecology is very important. There should be no
> spills, and leaking equipment should be immediately repaired or
> removed from service. Waste tanks and/or reclamation systems shall be
> provided for the disposal of fuel that cannot be used to service
> aircraft. This includes samples drawn from the tanks and filters for
> testing, inspection and maintenance purposes. Fuel shall never be
> poured onto the ground nor directly back into the storage tanks.
>
> Safety within our company and operations is a prime factor. The
> storage area shall have adequate lighting, fire extinguishers, and
> proper signage posted. Only fully qualified and responsible personnel
> should have access to the storage facility. The area should be secure
> (i.e., fenced in and locked when unattended).
>
> Fuel storage facilities must meet the following requirements in
> addition to the applicable operating standard, unless otherwise
> indicated. Reference **ATA-103** as applicable for requirements not
> covered in this manual. The locations with facilities that do not meet
> the requirements of this section shall submit a waiver request to the
> affected airline Quality Assurance Departments, as applicable.
> Internally, waiver requests shall be submitted in accordance with the
> guidelines established within AFQC-020. Approved waivers must be kept
> on file at the location for review and for as long as the waiver
> request is valid.
>
> Third-party owned facilities and equipment (regardless of location)
> may be operated and maintained in accordance with the Owner\'s
> Specifications and/or stipulated Contract Standard. ln such instances,
> the alternative standards must be readily available for corporate
> review. Fueling equipment leased for the purpose of conducting Company
> business must meet the FSM AFQCM standards but shall not be modified
> without the consent of the OEM and leasing agent.

> **300.1 GENERAL**
>
> This section covers quality control and safety requirements for
> receiving fuel into airport storage. These requirements can vary
> depending on method of delivery and facility layout. Dedicated or
> multi-product pipelines, and highway transport trucks nom1ally make
> deliveries of fuel. There are some airports receiving product directly
> from railroad tank cars or marine vessels. It is important that the
> facility operator recognizes that each of these transportation methods
> has different delivery requirements and that they be addressed in
> local receiving procedures to ensure fuel quality and safety.
>
> **300.1.1** Fuel Receipts shall be in accordance with the applicable
> standard the facility is operated under. Reference **ATA 103** for
> requirements not covered in this manual.
>
> **300.1.2** It is not acceptable to receive and dispense fuel from the
> same tank simultaneously.
>
> **NOTE**

In the event of a natural disaster or unforeseeable circumstances,
reference AFQC-040

Airline/Customer Notifications and AFQC-020 Waiver Request for guidance
on alternate methods and precautions for dispensing fuel.

> **300.1.3** Fully trained and qualified personnel shall handle all
> fuel receipts. It is the responsibility of our local management and
> their training resources to ensure that all applicable personnel
> follow the requirements Section 900 of this manual and are given on
> the job training with all pertinent documentation being completed
> prior to releasing them to perform these duties.
>
> **300.1.4** At all times, proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
> must be worn.

 300.2 JET FUEL RECEIVING SPECIFICATION AND PURITY STANDARDS 

a.  Jet fuel shall conform to ASTM D-1655 latest revision, or military
    contract requirements.

b.  In all phases of fuel handling, appearance of jet fuel shall be
    clear and bright (visually free of water, sediment and suspended
    matter). The odor of the fuel shall not be nauseating or irritating.

c.  The color of jet fuel generally ranges from water white to light
    straw or amber. Other colors may be an indication that the fuel has
    been contaminated by other products or unauthorized additives. In
    such cases, it shall be the facility operator\'s responsibility to
    discontinue fuel transfer and/or quarantine product until the fuel
    has been determined acceptable for aircraft use.

> **300.2.2** The following jet fuel purity and specification parameters
> should apply **UPSTREAM** of airport receiving filtration.

 NOTE 

> **It is important that the facility operator assigned the task and
> responsibility to receive jet fuel into storage tanks sample inbound
> deliveries upstream of receiving filtration for potential
> contamination or excessive water/dirt levels. Inbound jet fuel purity
> shall permit reasonable receiving filtration performance and service
> life. Upstream appearance ratings less than Clear & Bright may
> indicate excessive contamination levels which could result in
> shortened receiving filtration life and may increase operational
> costs.**
>
> **Unacceptable operational and economic issues based on upstream jet
> fuel purity levels are to be resolved between applicable shipper,
> facility operator and/or customer.**

ASSESSMENT A VISUAL a.2

> **300.2.4 Notes**

a.  A color membrane rating of 3-dry or greater may indicate a
    particulate contaminant problem. If a color rating of 3-dry is
    observed, proceed as follows:

    1.  Perform a subsequent particulate test consisting of two
        > membranes (piggyback) in plastic holder to compare color
        > difference between top and bottom membranes. If top and bottom
        > membranes have a color rating difference of 2 or less, fuel is
        > to be considered clean and acceptable. If difference is 3 or
        > greater, conduct a gravimetric (weight) analysis. Fuel is
        > unacceptable if gravimetric test ASTM D2276 results exceed
        > 2.0mg/G or 0.5 mg/L based on test sample size taken.

    2.  A Particulate Assessment rating of \"B\" or greater indicates
        > that solid particles are visible on the test membrane or in
        > the sample container. This observation may be an indication
        > that there is generation of contamination in system or failure
        > of filtration upstream of sample test connection. Particle
        > Assessment is an aid in communicating visual observations of
        > size and distribution of solids as they appear on test
        > membranes or the bottom of sample containers.

b.  The following action is required if RED DYE is detected.

    1.  The Appearance Test (White Bucket) shall be used to inspect for
        red dye contamination. The referee Appearance Test (White Bucket
        shall be the white porcelain bucket obtained from Gammon
        Technical Products, GTP - 1746B or GTP - 1746C. This test
        requires collecting approximately a 2-gallon sample with a fuel
        depth of 8 inches +/- 1.0 inch. The inspector (with normal
        vision or wearing corrective non- tinted lenses) performs a
        visual examination of the fuel for color under normal daylight
        conditions, or in any well-lighted room such as an office with
        fluorescent lighting. If the inspector is not sure of the fuel
        color, a consensus of the color should be obtained from several
        individuals.

    2.  Jet fuel with no visible red tint should be judged acceptable
        for use in aircraft.

    3.  A red tint resulting from refinery processing will usually
        disappear when exposed to light. Jet fuel is acceptable for use
        if the red tint disappears in less than 30 minutes after being
        exposed to light.

    4.  Jet fuel produced by blending a red dyed fuel with a non-dyed
        fuel may be acceptable, providing the resulting fuel has no
        visible red tint, and fuel satisfies applicable specifications.
        Blending is not to be performed at an airport fuel storage
        facility without prior authorization by affected airlines.

> **300.3 AVGAS FUEL RECEIVING SPECIFICATION AND PURITY STANDARDS**

a.  Avgas fuel shall conform to ASTM D-910, latest revision.

b.  In all phases of fuel handling, appearance of Avgas fuel shall be
    clear and bright (visually free of un-dissolved water, sediment and
    suspended matter). The odor of the fuel shall not be nauseating or
    irritating.

c.  The color of Avgas varies with the different grades:

> I\) **Blue ^=\ ^**Grade 100LL

2.  **Green ^=\ ^**Grade 100

3.  **Red=** Grade 80

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
d.  Other colors may indicate that other products may have contaminated
    the fuel. In such cases, it shall be the facility operator\'s
    responsibility to discontinue the fuel transfer and/or quarantine
    product until the fuel as been determined acceptable for aircraft
    use.

> **300.3.1** The following Avgas fuel purity and specification
> parameters shall apply anywhere in the system, i.e., both upstream and
> downstream of all filtration.

> rated flow of the vessel to comply with this requirement. The rated
> flow of any vessel cannot be exceeded.**

 CAUTION 

> **Full Flow Monitors shall not be used with fuels containing Fuel
> System Icing Inhibitors. The water removal performance of Full Flow
> Monitors may be reduced with fuel containing FSII.**
>
> C. All filtration vessels shall include:

1)  Air elimination provisions. Each filter vessel shall be fitted with
    a means for automatically venting trapped air from the top of the
    vessel. If associated piping would permit the vessel to drain and
    air to enter via the air eliminator, a soft-seated non-return
    (check) valve with an opening pressure of one pound must be
    installed.

2)  Direct reading pressure differential gauges. Piston type pressure
    differential gauges shall have a scale that can give a reading up to
    30 PSI differential. Piston type direct reading pressure
    differential gauges shall be equipped with provisions for testing
    full deflection of indicating piston. To prevent fuel from venting
    to the ground and/or recording erroneous pressure measurements, test
    valves must be spring-loaded or safety wired in the normal operating
    position except while the gauge is being tested.

3)  Manual sump drains - With valves having handles that are spring
    loaded to the closed position.

4)  Upstream and downstream membrane sampling connections, including
    probes and dust covers. Sampling connection locations must be
    labeled. The direction of flow markings on the probes must be
    visible (not painted) at all times.

5)  Pressure relief valves or other devices, which will prevent over
    pressurization due to thermal expansion of fuel, including a means
    for accommodating relieved fuel.

6)  Placards indicating month and year of the last filter change of
    vessel.

7)  Nameplate - A stainless steel or nonferrous metal nameplate shall be
    securely attached to the vessel proper. As a minimum, the nameplate
    shall include the following information:

    a.  The manufacturer\'s name and address.

    b.  The vessel\'s serial number and unit number.

    c.  The vessel\'s API/EI classification.

    d.  The Vessel\'s rated capacity for Jet A, Jet A-1, or Avgas.

    e.  The date of manufacture.

    f.  The number of and model numbers of the elements installed.

 400.1.2 PRESSURE CONTROLS 

> All aircraft fueling equipment shall have separate and independent
> primary and secondary fuel pressure control devices that limit the
> pressure to 50 psi or less at the nozzle under constant flow
> conditions.

a.  Primary fuel pressure control is intended to protect the aircraft
    under conditions of constant flow and also from pressure surge
    caused during aircraft valve closure.

b.  Secondary fuel pressure control is intended to protect the aircraft
    in the event of primary fuel control failure. Secondary controls
    must limit the fueling pressure (at the fuel nozzle) to 45 psi or
    less under conditions of constant flow.

c.  Fuel pressure control systems may utilize the following 1) Pressure
    controlling hydrant pit valves.

    2.  Pressure controlling hydrant pit couplers.

    3.  In-line pressure control valves.

    4.  Hose End Pressure Control Valves (HEPCV).

> **500.1 DEFUELING PROCEDURES (General)**
>
> Any operation that involves removing fuel from an aircraft, either for
> load adjustments or for maintenance purposes, is defined as
> de-fueling. De-fueling operations require specialconsideration.When
> requested to do any de-fuels for load adjustment, maintenance or
> contamination, the carrier, aircraft owner, etc., shall be responsible
> for the disposition of the fuel that was removed from their aircraft;
> whether it is pumped back into their aircraft over a specified agreed
> time, or disposed of through a waste hauler, etc. This includes the
> product de- fueled and any product it comes in contact with, i.e., if
> there is any product in the tanker truck used for de-fuel.

**WARNING!**

> **Fuel trucks utilizing monitors for Jet fuel filtration shall not be
> used for defueling aircraft.**

 NOTE 

> **Defueling aircraft directly into joint use fueling systems is not
> authorized unless all system users have unanimously approved a written
> procedure. The approval must come from the Quality Assurance
> Departments of each user and must be in writing.**

 CAUTION 

> **Receive fuel into an empty vehicle whenever possible, or other
> vehicle equipped for this purpose. If the defuel truck is not empty,
> the ullage (available storage capacity) must be calculated either by
> inventory records or strapping chart. Any remaining fuel in the defuel
> truck becomes part of the defueled product and must be returned to the
> responsible air carrier or owner.**

**WARNING!**

> **Defueled product shall not be returned to airport storage.**

 500.2 DE-FUELING PROCEDURES FOR LOAD ADJUSTMENT/MAINTENANCE 

> **500.2.1 Procedures:** The following procedures shall be complied
> with when defueling an aircraft for load adjustment/maintenance:

a)  Complete a Visual Appearance Test on sump samples drawn from the
    > filter sump (under pressure) and all tank compartments on the
    > defuel truck.

b)  Complete a Visual Appearance Test on a composite sample utilizing
    > all aircraft tanks to be defueled looking for visible
    > contamination such as water, particulates and microbial growth, if
    > practical.

c)  If results of checks outlined above give, without any doubt, no
    > reason to suspect the quality of the fuel, begin Defueling.
    > Utilize the bottom-load pre-check to determine

> that high-level protection is operable. If not, a monitor must be
> placed on the ladder to monitor the fuel level through an open dome
> cover.

d)  After defueling, and prior to uploading the defueled product, allow
    > the fueling vehicle to settle for 10 minutes then drain at least
    > one gallon of fuel from the tank sump(s) into a suitable container
    > and perform a visual inspection.

e)  Upon completion of de-fueling, re-circulate through a re-circulation
    > connection, not the bottom loading connection unless it connects
    > directly into the tank and not through the tank internal valve, a
    > volume equivalent to the contents of the Refueler, and then
    > perform the following:

> I\) Clear and bright test from all tank compartments and filter sump
>
> 2\) API gravity corrected to 60^°^F. (Range must be between 37^°^ to
