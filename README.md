> calibration agency or service traceable to the N.I.S.T., at minimum
> ANSI /NCSL Z540-l.
>
> **NOTE**
>
> **A placard identifying the date of calibration, the personnel who
> performed the calibration and the next due date shall be affixed to
> the tooling.**

b.  Master Meter/Prover Tank shall be calibrated as required by the
    applicable government agency in which the equipment is operated by

    not, the gauge must be replaced with one that meets the accuracy
    requirements

d.  Gammon and Shultz filter differential pressure gauges must be
    checked for accuracy by:

    1.  Replace the gauge protection filter element.

    2.  With no flow in the system, read the gauge. A gauge without
        defect must indicate within the zero band.

    3.  Establish full system flow. A gauge without defect must indicate
        a differential pressure greater than zero.

    4.  Actuate the test valve on the bottom of the gauge to vent the
        underside of the piston. The piston should move to the bottom of
        its travel smoothly without evidence of sticking as it moves. Be
        prepared to collect approximately 50ml of fuel from the outlet
        of the test valve. Return the test valve to the Normal position
        and secure.

    5.  Stop flow. The piston should move back to a position within the
        zero band.

> **Note:**
>
> **If the piston moves erratically or fails to return to the Normal
> band, disassemble and clean the piston and glass tube with applicable
> fuel and glass safe abrasive scrubber (i.e. Scotch Brite pad or
> equivalent).**

6.  Repeat the test after cleaning and reassembly. If the piston still
    does not return to zero, the spring must be replaced.

### MISFUELING PREVENTION AFQC-60 

> **60.1 PURPOSE**
>
> Delivering the wrong grade of fuel into an aircraft is termed a
> misfueling. It is essential that the right control procedures are in
> place at all times to avoid misfueling. The risk of delivering the
> wrong grade of fuel exists because many General Aviation (GA) aircraft
> and some airline type aircraft are over wing fueled and can therefore
> potentially be fueled with the wrong grade of fuel.
>
> The serious consequences of misfueling include:

-   Total engine failure due to knock damage if jet fuel is delivered
    into a spark ignition piston engine powered aircraft that requires
    avgas.

-   Ignition failure if avgas is delivered into a compression ignition
    (diesel) piston engine powered aircraft that requires jet fuel.

-   Potential engine failure or power loss is avgas is delivered that is
    below the minimum specified octane level for the engine type.

-   Vapor lock and engine failure due to fuel starvation if avgas is
    delivered into a turbine engine powered aircraft that requires jet
    fuel. Many turbine engines are capable of operating on avgas, but
    such operation is strictly controlled as described in the Pilot
    Operating Handbook.

> Measures are required to ensure that the correct grade of fuel is
> delivered when using an overwing (trigger) nozzle. Fueling personnel
> should never make an assumption about the grade of fuel required.
> Grade confirmation between the customer and fueling personnel must
> take place. All verbal requests shall be repeated back to the
> pilot/aircraft/airline representative and verbal requests alone are
> not acceptable if the aircraft does not have the relevant grade
> markings adjacent to the fill point. Whenever possible, written
> confirmation of the grade of fuel required shall be provided by the
> customer.
>
> **60.2 PROCEDURE**
>
> Before fueling commences, the operator shall check that the grade
> requested is the same as the grade marked on the aircraft, adjacent to
> the tank filler cap, and the same as the grade marked on the overwing
> fueling nozzle.
>
> If there is no grade marking on the aircraft, fueling shall not
> commence until a Fuel Confirmation Order Form reconfirming the grade
> of fuel required has been completed by the pilot or designated airline
> representative.
>
> If the grade marking on the aircraft is different to that of the
> fueling equipment, fueling must not commence until the discrepancy has
> been fully investigated and resolved in writing between the pilot or
> designated airline representatives.

### MISFUELING PREVENTION AFQC-60

> For turbine powered aircraft which do not accept the larger diameter
> jet fuel nozzle spout a small diameter jet fuel nozzle spout shall be
> available. These shall be kept in secure containers and only fitted
> for those fuelings where they are required and returned to their
> container when the fueling is complete. If a small diameter jet fuel
> nozzle spout is required to fuel the aircraft, fueling shall not
> commence until a Fuel Confirmation Order Form reconfirming the grade
> of fuel required has been completed by the pilot or designated airline
> representative.
>
> Written procedures shall be prepared to ensure that after fueling such
> aircraft the smaller spout is removed from service and replaced by the
> larger Jet Fuel spout. An alternate means of compliance would be to
> locate the Jet nozzle spout on the equipment in a holder which is
> interlocked with the Vehicle drive-off interlock system of the
> vehicle. Such a system will then require the jet nozzle to be
> reinstated before the equipment can be moved.
>
> The following additional precautions are applicable for overwing
> fueling:

-   Prior to fueling aircraft, and where a nozzle spout extension or
    funnel is required to avoid splash fueling ensure that the grade of
    fuel is confirmed in writing by completing the fuel order form with
    the pilot or designated airline representative.

-   Several companies produce reciprocating aircraft engines that are
    powered using Jet Fuel or Diesel Fuel. These engines are being
    installed on aircraft that typically had previously been fitted with
    engines that used Aviation Gasoline (Avgas).

    -   These aircraft represent a serious risk of misfueling by the
        delivery of Avgas to an engine designed for diesel fuel. Also,
        because these aircraft were originally designed for use with
        Avgas, most will have filling orifices that are too small for
        the normal 67mm Jet Fuel nozzle.

    -   Although some engines may be certified for use with Jet Fuel and
        Diesel, DIESEL FUEL MUST NOT be supplied to those aircraft.

    -   The use of a Fuel Confirmation Order Form is required for all
        refueling of dieselpowered aircraft types.

> Control functions and the testing procedures used to identify color
> vision deficiency in employees and job applicants tasked with Aviation
> Fuel Quality Control responsibilities.
>
> **70.2 SCOPE:**
>
> This policy applies to all FSM Group employees or applicants whose job
> functions include conducting Aviation Fuel Quality Control tasks,
> defined as one or more of the following:

1.  Visual testing of aviation fuels (white bucket, clear & bright)

2.  Filter Color Membrane and Particulate Test (Millipore)

3.  Free water testing (any approved method)

4.  Section 600 \[post-accident\] events which prescribe any of the
    aforementioned sampling or rating methods

> **70.3 RESPONSIBILITIES:**

A.  Corporate Training Manager will own and administer this policy in
    conjunction with individual location leadership.

B.  FSM Group shall comply with all obligations under the Americans with
    Disabilities Act (ADA) and other related Federal and State laws, as
    well as any collective bargaining agreements.

> **70.4 POLICY:**
>
> FSM Group takes pride in our into-plane business and providing the
> cleanest aviation fuel possible ranks among the highest reasons our
> customers continue coming back to our locations. Due to the
> complexities involved in tasks associated with Aviation Fuel Quality
> Control, and the potential for misidentifying color-rated fuels and
> quality control processes, the requirement for employees performing
> Aviation Fuel Quality Control tasks to possess color vision free of
> deficiency has been identified as a significant risk by the industry,
> as well as regulatory agencies.
>
> Color Blindness, more accurately defined as Color Vision Deficiency,
> is a hereditary condition that affects approximately 8% of the male
> population, and roughly 0.5% of the female population. Red/green
> deficiency (Protanopia or Deuteranopia, respectively) is most
> prevalent, although a more rare blue-yellow (Tritanomaly or
> Tritanopia) deficiency may also exist. The latter is concerning as
> certain colors, yellow hues for instance, can be perceived as having
> pink or red hues, which may result in \'false negatives\' determining
> the
>
> rating of turbine aviation fuel which can have a straw or pale yellow
> appearance. Presently, there is no treatment or cure to correct for
> color deficiency.
>
> Although generally inherited and affecting both eyes, in very rare
> cases color vision deficiency can affect one or both eyes, and may be
> caused by surgical procedures, traumatic injury, prolonged UV
> exposure, exposure to certain chemicals, alcoholism, or rare ailments.
> Color deficiencies prevent the proper identification of certain color
> spectrums and could pose a significant risk in safety-intensive fields
> such as aviation fuel quality control.
>
> Many industries currently require color vision absent deficiency as a
> prerequisite for employment in safety-sensitive positions. FSM Group,
> LLC., being the leader in business aviation services, is taking a
> proactive view with this issue and has developed this Aviation Fuel
> Quality Control Color Vision policy.
>
> **70.5 PROCEDURE:**
>
> **70.5.1 Testing Applicants**
>
> Personnel applying for aviation fuel quality control or M&O positions,
> with job Descriptions requiring the ability to distinguish the colors
> of fuels and/or rate various color values of required tests and
> checks, shall be initially tested for color blindness prior to
> assuming a quality control position. Should the applicant fail the
> initial color vision test, they will not be considered for positions
> which require rating color or contrast of fuel samples and sample
> media. However, the applicant may still perform mechanical aspects of
> tasks associated with aviation fuel quality control.
>
> **70.5.2 Initial Testing of Employees**
>
> Applicants for aviation fuel quality control-specific positions, and
> employees that currently perform or move into a position that performs
> Aviation Fuel Quality Control checks, as addressed above, will be
> subject to the initial color vision test. This will include all Fuel
> QC Department employees and any other persons engaged or who may
> engage in the rating of color and contrast of aviation fuels and
> sample media.
>
> **70.5.3 Recurrent Testing of Employees**
>
> Recurrent testing of employee color vision shall be performed once
> every three (3) years, using the color vision test method approved at
> the time of recurrency. It is further required that if an employee
> undergoes surgery to the eye(s), or incurs a significant eye injury,
> that the employee be retested to confirm the absence of color vision
> deficiency after the employee has recovered and has returned to work.

November 2025 © 2024 FSM Group

#### 70.5.4 Testing procedures 

> Test administration shall be completed as follows:

1.  Initial and recurrent color vision tests will be administratively
    managed by a designated location leadership team member (General
    Manager, HSE&T Manager/Supervisor).

2.  The Color Vision test will be administered utilizing the Ishihara
    Color Blindness Test.

3.  If the employee fails the test, less than 100%, the employee will be
    allowed to retake the test. If failed the second time, the employee
    will be retested a final time at an approved medical clinic.

> In the event this method of color vision testing system is no longer
> supported or becomes either obsolete, upgraded, or otherwise
> unavailable, the location shall follow the instruction of the
> Corporate Training Manager concerning color vision testing.

### 100.5 CONTAMINANTS 

> **100.5.1 General.**

-   Strict quality control measures are of the utmost importance,
    because aircraft power plant failure during flight can result in
    disaster. Effective fuel handling equipment and techniques for
    gasoline are fairly simple because gasoline has relative low
    viscosity and density giving it the ability to shed contaminants
    more easily than turbine fuels. With the introduction of turbine
    powered aircraft, the need for effective procedures and equipment to
    maintain fuel cleanliness is more critical than ever because of the
    ability of turbine fuel to maintain contaminants in suspension and
    carry them throughout the distribution system - ultimately into
    aircraft fuel tanks and engines.

-   Everyone involved in production, transportation, storage and
    delivery of aviation fuels (including fueling an aircraft), must
    work vigilantly to maintain fuel quality and cleanliness.

-   The more common forms of aviation fuel contaminants are solids,
    water, surfactants, microorganisms, and miscellaneous ones including
    the intermixing of grades or types of fuel. Surfactants and
    microorganisms, contaminants that are virtually unknown in aviation
    gasoline, have become critical with the advent of turbine fuels.

-   An important part of product quality control is a thorough
    understanding of some of the types and sources of fuel
    contamination.

-   Contaminants can be introduced into aviation fuels during the
    refining process, and particularly in the transfer of the fuel from
    the refinery to the aircraft. The fuel specification controls the
    fuel as produced by the refinery and insures a satisfactory product
    from the standpoint of impurities.

-   During the transfer process, water, rust, dust particles, and
    microorganisms are the major contaminants that can be added into the
    fuels. Good housekeeping, both in the transfer equipment and storage
    facilities, is most important in this case.

-   Added protection is provided by the use of filter/separators capable
    of efficiently removing significant quantities of water and solid
    particles. The coalescing capability of the filter/separators is
    protected by specification requirements, limiting materials
    detrimental to the ability of filter/separators to perfom1 their
    functions.

### • NOTE 

> **If a fuel supply is suspected of contamination, aircraft refueling
> must be discontinued from that source. Notify all affected aircraft
> operators if it is anticipated that such**
>
> **contamination might impact aircraft operations. Immediately
> investigate for the cause of**
>
> **the contamination and initiate appropriate corrective measures.
> Notification shall be given to the following personnel, with all
> pertinent information of the finding of the contamination and
> corrective measures:**
>
> **The Fuel Quality Control Department; and the responsible Vice
> President of the location.**
>
> **Fueling shall not be resumed from the system until the source of
> fuel contamination is found and removed.**
>
> **Fuel, suspected of possible contamination, shall be held in
> quarantine until selected fuel quality, purity or specification tests
> have determined that it is acceptable for aircraft use.**
>
> **Selected product tests and expected acceptance criteria are to be
> determined and mutually agreed upon by fueling vendor and all affected
> customers prior to approving**
>
> **fuel for future use. To the extent the fuel is no longer acceptable
> for aircraft use, it should be managed and/or disposed consistent with
> applicable federal, state and local requirements.**
>
> **100.5.2 Product Mixture.**
>
> It is usually the result of inadvertently mixing of dissimilar
> products. Contamination with a small amount of dissimilar product may
> not be readily discernible and may require laboratory testing for
> verification. A larger amount of contamination with a dissimilar
> product may be detected by a significant change in appearance or color
> or change in API Gravity.
>
> **100.5.3 Solids Contamination.**
>
> Solid contaminants are generally defined as those, which are insoluble
> in fuel.
>
> Solids may be present in aviation fuels in the form of sand, dust,
> dirt, rust, fibers,
>
> metal particles, rubber particles and others such as, valve lubricants
> and sludge produced by bacterial action. These solids often referred
> to as particulate matter, not only plug filters but may cause high
> wear in engines, metering units, valves and other aircraft equipment.
> Kerosene type turbine fuel has a greater tendency than Avgas to
> dislodge rust and scale from tank and piping surfaces. In addition,
> kerosene fuels, because of their greater viscosity, hold debris in
> suspension longer than gasoline.
>
> **Sources of solid contamination include:**

a.  Rust and scale formed on the inside of lines and tanks.

b.  Rubber particles from deteriorated hoses and gaskets.

c.  Dust, dirt and sand drawn in through vent pipes and open hatches.

d.  Fibers from damaged filters.

e.  Insoluble valve lubricants.

f.  Microbiological growth.

> **100.5.4 Water Contamination.**
>
> **Water occurs in aviation fuels in two forms, Dissolved and Free.**

a.  **Dissolved Water.** Water that is in a state of solution in the
    fuel. It is not visible and cannot be removed by a filter/separator.

> However, if a fuel saturated with dissolved water is cooled, free
> water is formed and some of this water will settle to the bottom of
> the tank or container. Except for changing to a free state upon
> temperature drop, dissolved water does not pose a problem to the
> aircraft.

b.  **Free Water.** Visible either as a cloud haze, emulsion, droplets,
    bulk amounts (water slug), or entrained.

> **NOTE**
>
> **Cloud haze is commonly referred to as entrained.**
>
> **NOTE**
>
> **No free water in the form of water slugs, visible water droplets or
> entrained water in excess of 15 ppm shall be delivered into an
> aircraft.**

-   Two common methods are used for removing free water:

    a.  Allowing fuel to settle in tanks or containers and draining the
        sumps.

    b.  Mechanical separation utilizing a filter/separator containing
        water coalescer and water separator cartridges or water
        absorbing cartridges (See each in definitions).

-   The best means to minimize the amount of water entering a system is
    through

> proper housekeeping and maintenance, i.e., regular sumping, keeping
> fixed storage full to minimize condensation, proper maintenance of
> openings and seals and by making certain that all fuel tender tanks,
> storage tanks and containers are \"dry\" before fuel is loaded into or
> taken out of them.
>
> **100.5.5 Surfactants.** Surfactants (surface active agents) are soap
> or detergent like materials sometimes found in petroleum fuels.
> Aviation fuels may become contaminated with surfactants when
> transported in equipment previously utilized for motor gasoline
> (mogas) or diesel fuels. These fuels usually contain surface-active
> agents purposely added to combat corrosion and improve fuel system
> cleanliness.
>
> Other sources of contamination include certain refinery processes,
> surfactants occurring naturally in certain crude oils and also certain
> microbes that are known to produce surfactants. Terminals and airport
> storage facilities usually remove surfactants from aviation fuel by
> water washing and/or most commonly by filtration through large clay
> treatment vessels. The clay is a highly porous material and the
> surfactants are more strongly attracted to them than they are the
> fuel. The clay vessel is normally positioned just prior to the
> filter/separator units.
>
> Surfactants in large concentrations usually appear as a tan to dark
> brown liquid, slimy or soapy to the touch, and with a sudsy-like
> water/fuel interface. \*Surfactants will render filter/separator
> elements ineffective.
>
> The signals of a surfactant-contaminated system are:

a.  Excess quantities of dirt and/or free water detected in the filter
    membrane test, or single element test.

b.  Discovery of slime in distribution system tanks and
    filter/separators.

c.  Rapid plugging or malfunctioning of filter/separators.

d.  Water downstream of filter separator.

#### NOTE 

> **When surfactants are discovered, care must be exercised to replace
> filter/separator elements and to clean storage tanks before the
> surfactants migrate to a downstream vehicle, such as a Refueler.**
>
> Turbine fuels, when transported by multi-product pipelines, will tend
> to pick up surfactants from the pipeline system. Therefore, all
> receipts directly from multiproduct pipelines should be clay treated
> before delivery into airport facilities.
>
> **100.5.6Microorganisms (microbes):** There are numerous varieties of
> microorganisms that can live in the free water, which accumulates in
> sumps and on the surfaces of storage and aircraft tanks. Microbial
> growth is widely considered more of a problem in jet fuels. However,
> AvGas systems have been known to also experience microbial growth - no
> relaxation in safeguards and surveillance is justified. Many
> microorganisms are airborne, while others are found in soil. Thus,
> there is constant exposure to inoculation with this type of
> contaminant.
>
> Under ideal conditions, microbes are capable of reproducing themselves
> by the millions in a matter of days. The debris and slimes generated
> by microbes may plug filters and promote corrosion.
>
> To prevent or retard microbial growth, the introduction of water into
> fuels should be scrupulously avoided through proper system design and
> the maintenance and testing of tank and line integrity, access
> hatches, gauge openings and vents. Any water finding its way into
> fuel, whether through condensation or accident, should be removed on a
> daily basis from storage tanks, filter/separator sumps, and Refueler
> tanks.

**NOTE** ^/^

> **The determination of microbial content is a procedure that should be
> reserved for the laboratory. It is important to note that these test
> results can often be misleading due to improper sampling procedures.**

##### 100.6 STATIC ELECTRICITY 

> **100.6.1 General.** Static electricity is a potential threat to safe
> fuel handling. Any relative motion between bodies - such as an
> aircraft in flight, a moving Refueler, product flowing through a
> pipeline or filter vessel, or movement within a body of liquid, can
> generate static electricity.
>
> Fires and explosions can result from these static charges, depending
> on the presence of flammable vapors, the intensity of the charge, and
> the rate at which the charge dissipates or bleeds off to ground.
>
> Simply generating a static charge is not hazardous. Most substances
> are good conductors and will normally dissipate or bleed off a static
> charge as quickly as it generates.
>
> A charge may accumulate faster than it can bleed off. For example, the
> pavement and low-conductive tires will insulate the charges generated
> in a moving Refueler. Fueling personnel must bleed off or equalize
> this charge at the loading rack through static wires and at the
> aircraft by bonding the Refueler to the aircraft.
>
> Jet fuels and other refined products are sometimes poor conductors. In
> these cases, the fuel itself accumulates static charges that do not
> readily bleed off or equalize through static wires to the internal
> surfaces of pipelines and tanks and then to ground.
>
> The accumulated bulk charge can create sparks that jump from the
> liquid\'s surface to the walls of the tank and other conductive
> projections inside the tank. Static discharges up to 18 inches in
> length have occurred on the surface of Jet fuel in a tank truck that
> was perfectly grounded and bonded to the fill stand piping and
> equipment.
>
> **100.6.2 Vapor Space.** Always assume the vapor space above aviation
> fuels is within the flammable range or explosive zone. Even when the
> temperature is not high enough to produce vapor above the fuel, other
> conditions may contribute to vapor formation such as:

a.  Misting or spraying high-flash fuels, which occurs during splash
    loading, enriches the composition of vapors that would normally be
    below the explosive range.

b.  Lean vapors can dilute overly rich vapors into a flammable mixture.
    This condition occurs when loading high-flash products such as jet
    fuel, into a truck compartment containing vapors from a previous
    low-flash cargo, such as AvGas.

> The aforementioned factors have contributed to fires that seemed
> unlikely because the temperature was not high enough to forn1
> flammable vapors.
>
> **100.6.3Velocity.** The rate of static charge generation varies
> directly with the relative velocity of a body or liquid and the medium
> through which it is moving.

a.  A fast-moving body will generate a greater charge than a slow moving
    one.

b.  Liquids moving rapidly through pipelines, or flowing through
    strainers, filter/separators and other media that finely divide or
    shear the fuel, are primary generators of static charges.
    Filter/separators seem to generate much higher charge intensities
    than other media. This is a key concern in handling aviation fuels,
    which require extremely fine filtration.

> **100.6.4 Conductivity** Fuel conductivity is expressed in units
> called Pico Siemens per meter, or Conductivity Units (CU). The
> conductivity of jet fuels can range from a fraction of a CU to
> hundreds of CUs.
>
> Fuel of one CU requires 12 seconds to relax or bleed off half of its
> charge. The time fuel requires to lose half its charge is the
> half-value time. High-conductivity fuels have a very brief half-value
> time (thousandths of a second), while low-conductivity fuels can
> retain potentially dangerous charges for 20 seconds or longer.
>
> Always allow enough time for charges to relax into the walls of
> piping, between the charge generation point (i.e., the
> filter/separator) and a receiving tank with a vapor space. A 30 second
> relaxation time is recommended.
>
> Use the following measures to reduce the hazard of fire or explosion
> when handling aviation fuels.

a.  Bond the truck to the loading rack or to the aircraft to ensure the
    continuity of conductive materials.

b.  When loading fuels, reduce flow rates to 3 feet per second until the
    compartment bottom is well covered, to prevent extreme turbulence of
    the product.

c.  Provide at least 30 seconds relaxation time through the piping
    between the discharge side of a filter/separator and the receiving
    tank or compartment.

d.  Never put metal or conductive objects (such as gauge tapes, sample
    containers and thermometers) in a tank or compartment while filling
    with aviation fuels. **Wait at least a couple of minutes after the
    flow stops** before using any of these devices.

> **300.1 GENERAL**
>
> This section covers quality control and safety requirements for
> receiving fuel into airport storage. These requirements can vary
> depending on method of delivery and facility layout. Dedicated or
> multi-product pipelines, and highway transport trucks nom1ally make
> deliveries of fuel. There are some airports receiving product directly
> from railroad tank cars or marine vessels. It is important that the
> facility operator recognizes that each of these transportation methods
> has different delivery requirements and that they be addressed in
> local receiving procedures to ensure fuel quality and safety.
>
> **300.1.1** Fuel Receipts shall be in accordance with the applicable
> standard the facility is operated under. Reference **ATA 103** for
> requirements not covered in this manual.
>
> **300.1.2** It is not acceptable to receive and dispense fuel from the
> same tank simultaneously.
>
> **NOTE**

In the event of a natural disaster or unforeseeable circumstances,
reference AFQC-040

Airline/Customer Notifications and AFQC-020 Waiver Request for guidance
on alternate methods and precautions for dispensing fuel.

> **300.1.3** Fully trained and qualified personnel shall handle all
> fuel receipts. It is the responsibility of our local management and
> their training resources to ensure that all applicable personnel
> follow the requirements Section 900 of this manual and are given on
> the job training with all pertinent documentation being completed
> prior to releasing them to perform these duties.
>
> **300.1.4** At all times, proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
> must be worn.

####### 300.2 JET FUEL RECEIVING SPECIFICATION AND PURITY STANDARDS 

a.  Jet fuel shall conform to ASTM D-1655 latest revision, or military
    contract requirements.

b.  In all phases of fuel handling, appearance of jet fuel shall be
    clear and bright (visually free of water, sediment and suspended
    matter). The odor of the fuel shall not be nauseating or irritating.

c.  The color of jet fuel generally ranges from water white to light
    straw or amber. Other colors may be an indication that the fuel has
    been contaminated by other products or unauthorized additives. In
    such cases, it shall be the facility operator\'s responsibility to
    discontinue fuel transfer and/or quarantine product until the fuel
    has been determined acceptable for aircraft use.

> **300.2.2** The following jet fuel purity and specification parameters
> should apply **UPSTREAM** of airport receiving filtration.

####### NOTE 

> **It is important that the facility operator assigned the task and
> responsibility to receive jet fuel into storage tanks sample inbound
> deliveries upstream of receiving filtration for potential
> contamination or excessive water/dirt levels. Inbound jet fuel purity
> shall permit reasonable receiving filtration performance and service
> life. Upstream appearance ratings less than Clear & Bright may
> indicate excessive contamination levels which could result in
> shortened receiving filtration life and may increase operational
> costs.**
>
> **Unacceptable operational and economic issues based on upstream jet
> fuel purity levels are to be resolved between applicable shipper,
> facility operator and/or customer.**

ASSESSMENT A VISUAL a.2

> **300.2.4 Notes**

a.  A color membrane rating of 3-dry or greater may indicate a
    particulate contaminant problem. If a color rating of 3-dry is
    observed, proceed as follows:

    1.  Perform a subsequent particulate test consisting of two
        > membranes (piggyback) in plastic holder to compare color
        > difference between top and bottom membranes. If top and bottom
        > membranes have a color rating difference of 2 or less, fuel is
        > to be considered clean and acceptable. If difference is 3 or
        > greater, conduct a gravimetric (weight) analysis. Fuel is
        > unacceptable if gravimetric test ASTM D2276 results exceed
        > 2.0mg/G or 0.5 mg/L based on test sample size taken.

    2.  A Particulate Assessment rating of \"B\" or greater indicates
        > that solid particles are visible on the test membrane or in
        > the sample container. This observation may be an indication
        > that there is generation of contamination in system or failure
        > of filtration upstream of sample test connection. Particle
        > Assessment is an aid in communicating visual observations of
        > size and distribution of solids as they appear on test
        > membranes or the bottom of sample containers.

b.  The following action is required if RED DYE is detected.

    1.  The Appearance Test (White Bucket) shall be used to inspect for
        red dye contamination. The referee Appearance Test (White Bucket
        shall be the white porcelain bucket obtained from Gammon
        Technical Products, #GTP - 1746B or GTP - 1746C. This test
        requires collecting approximately a 2-gallon sample with a fuel
        depth of 8 inches +/- 1.0 inch. The inspector (with normal
        vision or wearing corrective non- tinted lenses) performs a
        visual examination of the fuel for color under normal daylight
        conditions, or in any well-lighted room such as an office with
        fluorescent lighting. If the inspector is not sure of the fuel
        color, a consensus of the color should be obtained from several
        individuals.

    2.  Jet fuel with no visible red tint should be judged acceptable
        for use in aircraft.

    3.  A red tint resulting from refinery processing will usually
        disappear when exposed to light. Jet fuel is acceptable for use
        if the red tint disappears in less than 30 minutes after being
        exposed to light.

    4.  Jet fuel produced by blending a red dyed fuel with a non-dyed
        fuel may be acceptable, providing the resulting fuel has no
        visible red tint, and fuel satisfies applicable specifications.
        Blending is not to be performed at an airport fuel storage
        facility without prior authorization by affected airlines.

> **300.3 AVGAS FUEL RECEIVING SPECIFICATION AND PURITY STANDARDS**

a.  Avgas fuel shall conform to ASTM D-910, latest revision.

b.  In all phases of fuel handling, appearance of Avgas fuel shall be
    clear and bright (visually free of un-dissolved water, sediment and
    suspended matter). The odor of the fuel shall not be nauseating or
    irritating.

c.  The color of Avgas varies with the different grades:

> I\) **Blue ^=\ ^**Grade 100LL

2.  **Green ^=\ ^**Grade 100

3.  **Red=** Grade 80

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
d.  Other colors may indicate that other products may have contaminated
    the fuel. In such cases, it shall be the facility operator\'s
    responsibility to discontinue the fuel transfer and/or quarantine
    product until the fuel as been determined acceptable for aircraft
    use.

> **300.3.1** The following Avgas fuel purity and specification
> parameters shall apply anywhere in the system, i.e., both upstream and

> manufacturer to determine a configuration that will downgrade the
> rated flow of the vessel to comply with this requirement. The rated
> flow of any vessel cannot be exceeded.**

######## CAUTION 

> **Full Flow Monitors shall not be used with fuels containing Fuel
> System Icing Inhibitors. The water removal performance of Full Flow
> Monitors may be reduced with fuel containing FSII.**
>
> C. All filtration vessels shall include:

1)  Air elimination provisions. Each filter vessel shall be fitted with
    a means for automatically venting trapped air from the top of the
    vessel. If associated piping would permit the vessel to drain and
    air to enter via the air eliminator, a soft-seated non-return
    (check) valve with an opening pressure of one pound must be
    installed.

2)  Direct reading pressure differential gauges. Piston type pressure
    differential gauges shall have a scale that can give a reading up to
    30 PSI differential. Piston type direct reading pressure
    differential gauges shall be equipped with provisions for testing
    full deflection of indicating piston. To prevent fuel from venting
    to the ground and/or recording erroneous pressure measurements, test
    valves must be spring-loaded or safety wired in the normal operating
    position except while the gauge is being tested.

3)  Manual sump drains - With valves having handles that are spring
    loaded to the closed position.

4)  Upstream and downstream membrane sampling connections, including
    probes and dust covers. Sampling connection locations must be
    labeled. The direction of flow markings on the probes must be
    visible (not painted) at all times.

5)  Pressure relief valves or other devices, which will prevent over
    pressurization due to thermal expansion of fuel, including a means
    for accommodating relieved fuel.

6)  Placards indicating month and year of the last filter change of
    vessel.

7)  Nameplate - A stainless steel or nonferrous metal nameplate shall be
    securely attached to the vessel proper. As a minimum, the nameplate
    shall include the following information:

    a.  The manufacturer\'s name and address.

    b.  The vessel\'s serial number and unit number.

    c.  The vessel\'s API/EI classification.

    d.  The Vessel\'s rated capacity for Jet A, Jet A-1, or Avgas.

    e.  The date of manufacture.

    f.  The number of and model numbers of the elements installed.

    g.  If the vessel has been converted to utilize elements other than
        > what is on the original Nameplate, a Conversion Data Tag must
        > be posted adjacent to the original (not covering it)
        > indicating the model numbers and quantities of elements
        > currently installed.

    h.  The manufacturer\'s recommended element-change pressure
        > differential.

8)  All vessel interiors of mild steel shall be protected with an
    approved epoxy coating.

####### 400.1.2 PRESSURE CONTROLS 

> All aircraft fueling equipment shall have separate and independent
> primary and secondary fuel pressure control devices that limit the
> pressure to 50 psi or less at the nozzle under constant flow
> conditions.

a.  Primary fuel pressure control is intended to protect the aircraft
    under conditions of constant flow and also from pressure surge
    caused during aircraft valve closure.

b.  Secondary fuel pressure control is intended to protect the aircraft
    in the event of primary fuel control failure. Secondary controls
    must limit the fueling pressure (at the fuel nozzle) to 45 psi or
    less under conditions of constant flow.

c.  Fuel pressure control systems may utilize the following 1) Pressure
    controlling hydrant pit valves.

    2.  Pressure controlling hydrant pit couplers.

    3.  In-line pressure control valves.

    4.  Hose End Pressure Control Valves (HEPCV).

    5.  Pressure switches, which will cause rapid shutdown of fuel flow
        > in the event of high fueling pressure.

###### CAUTION 

**FUELING PRESSURE CONTROL SYSTEMS SHALL NEVER ALLOW THE ACTUAL FUEL
PRESSURE, MEASURED AT THE FUEL NOZZLE, TO EXCEED THE PRESSURE INDICATED
BY THE OPERATOR\'S GAUGE.**

####### 400.1.3 DEADMAN CONTROL SYSTEM 

> All aircraft fueling equipment shall have a hand-held Deadman control
> system, which must completely stop fuel flow within 5% of the fuel
> flow rate at the time the Deadman is released. At flow rates below 50%
> of rated flow, a shutdown in 10% of the fuel flow rate is allowed.
>
> **EXAMPLE:**
>
> **If actual fuel flow rate at the time of deadman control release is

> **500.1 DEFUELING PROCEDURES (General)**
>
> Any operation that involves removing fuel from an aircraft, either for
> load adjustments or for maintenance purposes, is defined as
> de-fueling. De-fueling operations require specialconsideration.When
> requested to do any de-fuels for load adjustment, maintenance or
> contamination, the carrier, aircraft owner, etc., shall be responsible
> for the disposition of the fuel that was removed from their aircraft;
> whether it is pumped back into their aircraft over a specified agreed
> time, or disposed of through a waste hauler, etc. This includes the
> product de- fueled and any product it comes in contact with, i.e., if
> there is any product in the tanker truck used for de-fuel.

**WARNING!**

> **Fuel trucks utilizing monitors for Jet fuel filtration shall not be
> used for defueling aircraft.**

###### NOTE 

> **Defueling aircraft directly into joint use fueling systems is not
> authorized unless all system users have unanimously approved a written
> procedure. The approval must come from the Quality Assurance
> Departments of each user and must be in writing.**

####### CAUTION 

> **Receive fuel into an empty vehicle whenever possible, or other
> vehicle equipped for this purpose. If the defuel truck is not empty,
> the ullage (available storage capacity) must be calculated either by
> inventory records or strapping chart. Any remaining fuel in the defuel
> truck becomes part of the defueled product and must be returned to the
> responsible air carrier or owner.**

**WARNING!**

> **Defueled product shall not be returned to airport storage.**

######## 500.2 DE-FUELING PROCEDURES FOR LOAD ADJUSTMENT/MAINTENANCE 

> **500.2.1 Procedures:** The following procedures shall be complied
