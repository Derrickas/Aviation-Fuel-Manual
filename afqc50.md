## Aviation Fuel Quality Control Manual - 2025 Edition

AFQC-50 - TOOL CALIBRATION

November 2025 (Rev A)

## 50.1 Purpose

The purpose of this section is to establish requirements and procedures for the calibration, maintenance, and control of tools, gauges, and test equipment used in aviation fuel quality control activities. This ensures measurement accuracy, traceability to recognized standards, and compliance with regulatory and FSM Group requirements.

## 50.2 Scope

This policy applies to all FSM-operated facilities that utilize measuring or test equipment for aviation fuel inspection, sampling, and quality verification. It includes hydrometers, thermometers, pressure gauges, conductivity meters, timers, and any other devices used to determine fuel quality parameters.

## 50.3 Responsibilities

Responsibilities for maintaining compliance with this section are as follows:  
1\. \*\*Quality Control Personnel:\*\* Ensure calibration due dates are observed and that tools are available, clean, and properly identified.  
2\. \*\*Supervisors:\*\* Review calibration records regularly and coordinate with approved calibration vendors.  
3\. \*\*General Manager:\*\* Verify that all tools and equipment at the facility are within calibration status.  
4\. \*\*Corporate Quality Assurance:\*\* Maintain oversight of the calibration program and ensure conformity with FSM's Quality Management System and AFQC-710.

## 50.4 Calibration Program Requirements

All tools and equipment requiring calibration shall be included in the site's Calibration Register and assigned a unique identification number. Calibration must be performed at intervals recommended by the manufacturer, regulatory standards, or as determined by historical performance trends.

Calibration services must be traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other recognized international standards. Certificates of Calibration shall clearly indicate the equipment identification, calibration date, due date, standards used, and technician signature.

Each calibrated tool must bear a legible calibration label or tag indicating:  
\- Date of calibration  
\- Calibration due date  
\- Technician initials or company ID  
\- Equipment identification number

## 50.5 Out-of-Tolerance Equipment Handling

Any tool or instrument found to be out of tolerance shall be immediately removed from service and labeled 'OUT OF CALIBRATION.' A corrective action must be initiated to determine the potential impact on previous fuel test results or measurements. If results obtained with the nonconforming equipment cannot be verified, the affected fuel batches or systems must be re-tested using calibrated tools.

## 50.6 Documentation and Recordkeeping

All calibration records must be maintained in accordance with AFQC-710 (Digital Record Control Standard). Records shall include calibration certificates, vendor reports, and calibration logs, retained for a minimum of three years. Electronic records must include metadata identifying the responsible technician and equipment number.

## 50.7 Calibration Log Template

The following table shall be used as the standard format for recording calibration data at each facility:

| Equipment ID | Description | Calibration Date | Due Date | Calibrated By | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |

## 50.8 Improvement Integration Note

This chapter incorporates 2026 improvement plan recommendations, including traceable calibration documentation, digital record retention under AFQC-710, clear accountability for equipment control, and the introduction of standardized calibration logs and identification practices across FSM facilities.
