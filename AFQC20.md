## 20.1 Purpose

This section establishes FSM Group's procedures for requesting, approving, and documenting waivers from established fuel quality control policies. Waivers are authorized temporary deviations from approved standards or procedures when justified and approved by management. They are intended to maintain operational continuity without compromising safety, quality, or regulatory compliance.

## 20.2 Scope

The waiver process applies to all FSM-operated and contracted fuel facilities where compliance with standard procedures may not be immediately feasible. Waivers shall be limited in duration, fully documented, and approved prior to implementation.

## 20.3 References

\- ATA Specification 103 §2.1.4 - Waivers to Standard Procedures  
\- FSM Group Corporate Quality Policy  
\- AFQC-700 / AFQC-710 - Forms and Record Control  
\- AFQC-1000 - Manual Responsibilities

## 20.4 Responsibilities

Waivers must be reviewed and approved through the following authority chain based on their category and risk impact:

| Waiver Category | Approval Authority | Maximum Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operational | Quality Control Supervisor | 30 days |
| Equipment | Quality Manager / HSE Manager | 60 days |
| Testing | Quality Manager and Corporate QA | 60 days |
| Documentation | General Manager / Designee | 15 days |

## 20.5 Procedure

All waiver requests shall be submitted using the FSM Waiver Request Form (Form 20.1). Requests must include the following details:

1\. The policy, standard, or procedure from which the waiver is requested.  
2\. Justification for the request, including any operational, logistical, or safety constraints.  
3\. Proposed alternate method to ensure continued safety and quality compliance.  
4\. Anticipated duration and corrective measures planned.  
5\. Required approvals as specified in Section 20.4.

## 20.6 Waiver Request Form (Form 20.1)

The form below replicates the official 2025 format and must be completed for each waiver request.

| Request Number: |     |
| --- | --- |

## 20.7 Approvals

The following approvals are required prior to waiver implementation:

## 20.8 Recordkeeping

All approved waiver forms must be stored electronically in accordance with AFQC-710 (Digital Record Control Standard). Locations shall retain both digital and printed copies for a minimum of three years or until closure. All open waivers will be reviewed during internal audits and management review cycles.

## 20.9 Closure

When the condition requiring the waiver has been resolved, the approving authority must formally close the waiver. Closure must include confirmation of corrective actions, a signature by the final approver, and a closure date entry in the Waiver Register. Closed waivers are archived under the location's document retention schedule.

## 20.10 Improvement Integration

This revision integrates improvement items from FSM's 2026 AFQCM Improvement Plan, including:  
\- Clarified approval process with defined durations.  
\- Explicit digital recordkeeping linkage (AFQC-710).  
\- Reinforced closure verification process.  
\- Inclusion of risk and accountability considerations.
