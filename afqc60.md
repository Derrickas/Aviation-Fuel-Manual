## Aviation Fuel Quality Control Manual - 2025 Edition

AFQC-60 - MISFUELING PREVENTION

November 2025 (Rev A)

## 60.1 Purpose

The purpose of this section is to establish standardized policies and procedures to prevent aircraft misfueling incidents. Misfueling occurs when the incorrect grade of aviation fuel is dispensed into an aircraft, which can result in catastrophic engine damage or failure. This policy defines preventive measures, verification steps, and personnel responsibilities to ensure the integrity and safety of fueling operations.

## 60.2 Scope

This policy applies to all FSM-operated fueling facilities and contractors engaged in aircraft fueling operations. It covers all fueling activities involving Jet A, Avgas, and Jet A-1 products, including over-wing and under-wing fueling. It also applies to all associated quality control and fueling personnel responsible for aircraft identification and fuel confirmation.

## 60.3 Responsibilities

The following personnel are responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy:  
1\. \*\*Fueling Operators:\*\* Verify aircraft identification, grade markings, and fuel order before each fueling.  
2\. \*\*Supervisors / QC Technicians:\*\* Ensure all fueling personnel are trained in misfueling prevention procedures (AFQC-900).  
3\. \*\*General Manager:\*\* Maintain oversight of misfueling prevention compliance and ensure incidents are documented per AFQC-710.  
4\. \*\*Corporate Quality Assurance:\*\* Monitor incident reports, coordinate root cause investigations, and ensure training and procedural updates are implemented across all locations.

## 60.4 Misfueling Prevention Requirements

All aircraft fueling operations shall adhere to the following misfueling prevention controls:  
1\. Visually verify the aircraft fuel grade placard and fueling equipment grade marking match prior to fueling.  
2\. Confirm fuel grade with the flight crew or pilot in command (PIC) when applicable.  
3\. No fueling shall proceed if the aircraft placard is missing, damaged, or inconsistent with the fuel order.  
4\. When discrepancies are identified, complete a Fuel Confirmation Form and notify the supervisor.  
5\. Maintain color-coded and mechanically incompatible fueling nozzles for Jet A and Avgas systems.  
6\. Remove and secure small jet fuel spouts when fueling turbine aircraft to prevent use on piston or diesel aircraft.  
7\. Clearly label fueling equipment, hoses, and nozzles per ATA 103 Section 2.4.3.

## 60.5 Fueling Procedure

Fueling personnel shall follow the sequence below for all fueling operations:  
1\. Inspect fuel grade placard on the aircraft wing or fueling port.  
2\. Verify fueling truck or cart product identification tag and grade indicator.  
3\. Conduct a verbal confirmation with the pilot or flight crew of the required fuel type.  
4\. Match nozzle spout and connection size to ensure compatibility (Jet A larger spout, Avgas smaller orifice).  
5\. Complete fueling per standard operating procedures.  
6\. Document confirmation using the Fuel Confirmation Form and retain the record under AFQC-710.

## 60.6 Documentation and Recordkeeping

All misfueling prevention records, including Fuel Confirmation Forms, incident reports, and training records, must be maintained in accordance with AFQC-710 (Digital Record Control). Records shall include date, aircraft tail number, fueling location, fuel type confirmed, personnel involved, and any corrective actions taken. Records shall be retained for a minimum of three years and be readily accessible for audits and investigations.

## 60.7 Precautions and Fuel Type Reference

The following table provides quick-reference information for preventing fuel grade cross-contamination:

| Fuel Type | Typical Use | Nozzle Type / Size | Precautions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jet A / Jet A-1 | Turbine aircraft | Wide spout (2.5 in) | Do not use small spout. Verify placards. |
| Avgas 100LL | Reciprocating aircraft | Narrow spout (1.0 in) | Never connect Jet A nozzle to Avgas aircraft. |
| Diesel (Jet-compatible) | Diesel piston aircraft | Wide spout (Jet style) | Confirm fuel grade; treat as Jet fuel system. |

## 60.8 Improvement Integration Note

This revision incorporates recommendations from FSM's 2026 AFQCM Improvement Plan, including:  
\- Cross-references to AFQC-710 (Digital Record Control) and AFQC-900 (Training Requirements).  
\- Inclusion of a standardized Fuel Confirmation Form process.  
\- Clarified nozzle management and labeling standards per ATA 103.  
\- Enhanced accountability for misfueling event documentation and corrective actions.
