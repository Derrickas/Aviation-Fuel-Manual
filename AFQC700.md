700.1 GENERAL

The forms included in this section shall be utilized to facilitate presentation of the information required in the documentation for each part of the Fuel Quality Control Program.

Any deviations from these forms/formats must be submitted, reviewed and approved through the waiver process before use. Reference AFQC Manual, section 020.

It is necessary to utilize the format shown to achieve system standardization in presentation of the information required.

The legible signature or initials of the person performing the tasks or the person accepting responsibility for the performance of the tasks is required

- A record of each person's name or employee number, signature and initials must be maintained on file for review. (SignatureRoster)
- Supporting documentation with the signature or initials of the person actually performing the tasks must be available if another person signed the form accepting responsibility for accomplishment of the tasks.
- When a person accepting responsibility that the tasks were completed and is transferring the information on to the offcial (final) records, they are to print the last name of the person who actually performed the task and beside it write in their (the transfer person's) initials.
- All entries on the Fuel Quality Control Records must be made in Blue or Black ink only.

Corrections which are required to be made to fuel quality control records or other paper documentation, which from time to time are subject to scrutiny, review by the airline, fuel supplier, airport or any other local, state or federal enforcement agency having jurisdiction in such matters, shall be accomplished in accordance with the following:

Mark through the entry to be replaced on the form in ink by drawing a single line through it, whereby the entry is still legible. Enter the correct date in ink either immediately adjacent to the crossed-out entry or as close as formatting permits. Draw an arrow on the form to the point of entry of the new information if it is not obvious where such information is to be introduced.

The person entering the corrected date shall enter their initials next to the correction. It is recommended that at the bottom of the page the initials be, once again, written with the person's full name and title adjacent to it. ALL ENTRIES MUST BE MADE LEGIBLY.

# NOTE

Under no circumstances should any records or documentation which are subject to governmental or customer review (both periodic and casual) be altered using "whiteout", as the validity of the document may immediately be called into question. Quality control, training and other safety-related records have, in the past, been utilized in both the defense and prosecution of claims involving our company's personnel and activities.

Consequently, their validity, correctness and completeness must be above reproach at all times.

Otherwise, FSM invites allegations of manipulation, misrepresentation and falsification of its records. Our company is routinely required to make representations within its ground handling, into-plane fueling, and M&O contracts that records shall be properly and timely maintained to reflect accuracy at all times and that the airlines, airport and other agencies with regulatory oversight have the right to inspect such records at any time to verify our company's compliance.

Evidence of non-compliance is deemed to be an act of default under the terms of most agreements and subjects our company to cancellation of the subject contracts, as well as, constituting a potential default under the terms of its master lease and operating agreement with the airport. In the instance of litigation, it could easily result in the loss of the claim or case being defended; as such documentation is often both singular and pivotal. Please undertake such record keeping tasks with care and diligence at all times.

700.2 RECORD KEEPNG

- All required forms must be completed in their entirety.
- All required checks and tests must be performed and completed at the required frequency limitation
- The legible signature or initials of the person performing the task or the employee accepting responsibility for accomplishment of the tasks is required.
  - If initials or employee identification numbers are used, a record (Signature roster) of each person's name (typed), signature and initials shall be maintained on file and available for review.
  - Supporting documentation with the signature or initials of the person actually performing the tasks shall be maintained on file and available for review if another person has signed the form accepting responsibility for accomplishment of the tasks.
  - Records shall indicate when fueling equipment and/or facilities are not in service and why.
