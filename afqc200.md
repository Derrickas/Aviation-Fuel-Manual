##### FUEL STORAGE FACILITY REQUIREMENTS (General)

Fuel storage facilities/systems are designed to assure product segregation in order to prevent the accidental mixing of dissimilar fuels; therefore, the system must be properly designed, color-coded and placarded for the type and grade of fuel in each tank.

Protection of the ecology is very important. There should be no spills, and leaking equipment should be immediately repaired or removed from service. Waste tanks and/or reclamation systems shall be provided for the disposal of fuel that cannot be used to service aircraft. This includes samples drawn from the tanks and filters for testing, inspection and maintenance purposes. Fuel shall never be poured onto the ground nor directly back into the storage tanks.

Safety within our company and operations is a prime factor. The storage area shall have adequate lighting, fire extinguishers, and proper signage posted. Only fully qualified and responsible personnel should have access to the storage facility. The area should be secure (i.e., fenced in and locked when unattended).

Fuel storage facilities must meet the following requirements in addition to the applicable operating standard, unless otherwise indicated. Reference **ATA-103** as applicable for requirements not covered in this manual. The locations with facilities that do not meet the requirements of this section shall submit a waiver request to the affected airline Quality Assurance Departments, as applicable. Internally, waiver requests shall be submitted in accordance with the guidelines established within AFQC-020. Approved waivers must be kept on file at the location for review and for as long as the waiver request is valid.

Third-party owned facilities and equipment (regardless of location) may be operated and maintained in accordance with the Owner's Specifications and/or stipulated Contract Standard. In such instances, the alternative standards must be readily available for corporate review. Fueling equipment leased for the purpose of conducting Company business must meet the FSM AFQCM standards but shall not be modified without the consent of the OEM and leasing agent.

#### CAUTION

**Zinc galvanized materials shall not be used in jet fuel service. No copper alloys, cadmium plating or plastic materials are permitted for main fuel piping. The use of copper or copper alloy materials for other components must be minimized.**

#### CAUTION

**Where more than one type or grade of fuel is stored in a fuel storage system, completely segregated systems are required. The use of isolation valves or blind flanges is not acceptable methods ofproduct type or grade separation. This shall include the use of non- compatible connections between systems for both receiving and dispensing to prevent the accidental mixing of products.**

#### HYDRANT SYSTEM QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS

The following checks shall be performed on all hydrant-fueling systems servicing aircraft and at the frequencies specified. Additional tasks or more frequent checks may be required based on local conditions.

- - 1. All personnel engaged in ramp operations shall be continuously observant of abnormal conditions that may exist in and around fuel pits. Any fuel leaks, fire/safety hazards, or adverse conditions must be reported immediately.
        - Hydrant systems or segments of hydrant systems not in daily use shall have all daily, monthly, semi-annual and annual checks current and recorded before the system or segment is returned to service. Based on fuel test results, flushing may be required by aircraft operator prior to use. Records shall indicate when systems are out of service and why. When necessary, hydrant systems must be flushed per requirements listed in Appendix E and applicable EI standards.
        - Only fully trained and qualified personnel shall perform any and all fuel facility quality control checks and tests.
        - At all times, proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) must be worn.

#### NOTE

Each location is to have blue prints and/or diagrams on hand and accessible for all personnel that work on the hydrant system to review and use. The blue prints and diagrams shall show the entire system and location of all pits and vaults including, but not limited to; hydrants, isolation vaults, control pits, low point and high point valve pits, emergency shut off vaults, etc. All hydrants, isolation vaults, control pits, low point and high point valve pits, emergency shut off vaults, etc., shall be clearly identified by location and function.

#### HYDRANT SYSTEM DAILY QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS

Perform daily fuel facility checks at the beginning of each work day including weekends and holidays. Record the results of all checks on the appropriate paper or digital form. The daily checks required by ATA 103 are listed in the table below.

- 1. **HYDRANT SYSTEM WEEKLY QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS**

There are no weekly hydrant checks required by ATA 103.

#### HYDRANT SYSTEM MONTHLY QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS

Perform monthly fuel facility checks once every calendar month and prior to the end of the third week of the month. The monthly check must be within one month+/- five days of the previous month's check. For instance, a monthly check conducted on the 8th of the month would require the next month's checks to be conducted between 3rd and the 13th of the next month. Record the results of all checks on the appropriate paper or digital form. The monthly checks required by ATA 103 are listed in the table below.

| EFSO | 2.7.4.4 |

#### HYDRANT SYSTEM QUARTERLY QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS

Perform quarterly fuel facility checks once every three calendar months and within three months+/- 10 days of the previous check. For instance, quarterly checks conducted on February 14<sup>th</sup> would require the next quarter's checks to be conducted between May 4<sup>th</sup> and May 24<sup>th</sup>. Record the results of all checks on the appropriate paper or digital form. This flexibility does not allow for less than four quarterly checks per calendar year.
