## Aviation Fuel Quality Control Manual - 2025 Edition

AFQC-70 - COLOR VISION TESTING

November 2025 (Rev A)

## 70.1 Purpose

The purpose of this section is to establish FSM Group's policy for color vision testing of personnel involved in aviation fuel quality control activities. Accurate color discrimination is essential for evaluating fuel clarity, color, and contamination indicators during quality control inspections. This program ensures that only individuals with normal color vision perform duties requiring accurate visual fuel testing.

## 70.2 Scope

This policy applies to all FSM Group employees and applicants whose duties include aviation fuel quality inspections, testing, or evaluation activities. It covers personnel responsible for performing white bucket tests, filter membrane color assessments, free water detection, and other visual evaluations requiring accurate color interpretation. This policy also applies to recurrent testing for employees performing these duties.

## 70.3 Responsibilities

1\. \*\*Corporate Training Manager:\*\* Administers the color vision testing program and ensures qualified personnel and approved testing methods are used.  
2\. \*\*General Manager / Site Leadership:\*\* Ensures all personnel subject to this policy are tested and results are maintained per AFQC-710.  
3\. \*\*Quality Assurance Department:\*\* Reviews and audits test results for compliance with regulatory and company standards.  
4\. \*\*Employees:\*\* Must complete required color vision testing and immediately report any changes in vision or color perception.

## 70.4 Policy

FSM Group recognizes that accurate color vision is critical to safe and effective aviation fuel quality control. Personnel with impaired color perception may not be able to detect fuel contamination, discoloration, or incorrect product type. Approximately 8% of males and 0.5% of females have some form of color vision deficiency, typically inherited. There is currently no corrective treatment for congenital color blindness; however, appropriate job placement and supervision will ensure continued compliance and safety.

This policy aligns with ATA 103 and applicable occupational safety regulations. All testing shall be conducted fairly and consistently and in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

## 70.5 Procedure

Color vision testing shall be conducted using the \*\*Ishihara Color Blindness Test\*\* or an equivalent validated method approved by Corporate QA and the Corporate Training Manager. Testing shall be administered by trained site leadership (General Manager, HSE & Training Manager, or Supervisor) under controlled lighting conditions.

\*\*70.5.1 Testing Applicants:\*\* All new applicants for positions involving visual inspection of fuel must pass a color vision test prior to assignment. Applicants who do not pass may not perform fuel-rating or testing duties.  
\*\*70.5.2 Initial Testing of Employees:\*\* All employees currently performing fuel inspection or testing must complete an initial color vision test. Results shall be documented and retained per AFQC-710.  
\*\*70.5.3 Recurrent Testing of Employees:\*\* Recurrent testing shall be performed at least once every three (3) years, or immediately following any eye injury, surgery, or reported change in vision.  
\*\*70.5.4 Testing Procedures:\*\* Personnel are permitted one retest if the initial test result is inconclusive. If the retest is failed, a certified medical evaluation must be obtained from an approved ophthalmologist or optometrist. If test methods or materials change, Corporate Training will issue updated instructions and ensure retraining as required.

## 70.6 Documentation and Recordkeeping

All color vision test records shall be maintained in accordance with AFQC-710 (Digital Record Control). Documentation must include the employee name, test date, method used, administrator's name, and results. Electronic records shall be stored within FSM's Quality Management System and retained for a minimum of three (3) years after employment termination.

## 70.7 Competency and Training Integration

Color vision testing is an integral part of FSM Group's competency program (AFQC-900). Employees who do not meet the visual testing requirement shall be reassigned to roles that do not involve color-dependent quality evaluations. Training records shall reflect compliance with this testing requirement as part of the annual competency review process.

## 70.8 Improvement Integration Note

This chapter incorporates improvements from FSM's 2026 AFQCM Improvement Plan, including:  
\- Defined retesting intervals and documentation standards.  
\- Integration with AFQC-710 (Digital Record Control) and AFQC-900 (Training and Competency).  
\- Enhanced responsibilities for Corporate Training and QA oversight.  
\- Clarified compliance with ADA and industry safety standards.
